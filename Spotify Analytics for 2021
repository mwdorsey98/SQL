#In this project I used data from Spotify in 2021 to get some information regarding which tracks were most popular, had the best danceability, highest tempo, etc.
Below is the code I used to gather this data:



What were the most popular songs at the time?

SELECT track_name, 
artist_name, 
AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;


What are the top ten songs with the highest danceability?

SELECT track_name,
artist_name,
popularity,
AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY avg(danceability) desc
LIMIT 10;

Which Tracks are the most acoustic?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, AVG(acousticness)
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY avg(acousticness) desc
LIMIT 10;

Which songs had the highest tempo?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY tempo desc
LIMIT 10;
