#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data.


#1. I was tasked with pulling together data from both tables to show the titles, dates added, a description, the cast, and the director from shows and movies on Netflix.

SELECT n.title, n.date_added, n.description, p.cast, p.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS n
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS p
ON n.show_id = p.show_id;


#2. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)

SELECT COUNT(title) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';


#3. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?

SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";


#4. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 

SELECT *
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;


#5. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 

SELECT p.director, t.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS p
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS t
ON p.show_id = t.show_id
WHERE title = 'Bright Star';


#6. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY "release_year" asc
LIMIT 1;
